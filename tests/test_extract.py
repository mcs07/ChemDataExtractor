To a stirred solution of benzylamine (7.8 mL, 70.8 mmol) in toluene (60 mL) under cooling with ice bath, chloroacetyl chloride (4 g, 35.4 mmol) was slowly added. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 1h at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, the crude reaction was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL) and washed with water (3 × 50 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and the solvent evaporated under vacuum. The product was obtained as a white solid (6.30 g, 97%). m.p. 91–92 °C (93–96 °C from literature) [23]; 1H-NMR (CDCl3) δ 4.11 (s, 2H), 4.50 (d, 2H, J = 6.0 Hz), 6.89 (br s, 1H), 7.26–7.36 (m, 5H, Ar-H).'),

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h, then NaN3 (3.01 g, 46.3 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, water (0.8 mL) was added dropwise and the whole was refluxed for 5 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with chloroform. The combined organic layers were washed successively with water, NaOH solution 1M and saturated NaCl solution and dried over anhydrous MgSO4.
