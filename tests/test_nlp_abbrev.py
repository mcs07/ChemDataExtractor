                         compounds that may be toxic to biota. When water is scarce, a reduced dilution capacity may
                         amplify the effects of chemical pollution. Therefore, studying the response of natural
                         communities to compromised water flow and to toxicants is critical for assessing how global
                         change may affect river ecosystems. This work aims to investigate how an episode of drought
                         might influence the response of river biofilms to pulses of triclosan (TCS). The objectives
                         were to assess the separate and combined effects of simulated drought (achieved through
                         drastic flow alteration) and of TCS exposure on biofilms growing in artificial channels.'''),
            Paragraph('''Thus, three-week-old biofilms were studied under four conditions: Control (normal water flow);
                         Simulated Drought (1 week reduced flow+2 days interrupted flow); TCS only (normal water flow
                         plus a 48-h pulse of TCS); and Simulated Drought+TCS. All channels were then left for 2 weeks
                         under steady flow conditions, and their responses and recovery were studied.
                         Several descriptors of biofilms were analyzed before and after each step. Flow reduction and
                         subsequent interruption were found to provoke an increase in extracellular phosphatase
                         activity, bacterial mortality and green algae biomass. The TCS pulses severely affected
                         biofilms: they drastically reduced photosynthetic efficiency, the viability of bacteria and
                         diatoms, and phosphate uptake. Latent consequences evidenced significant combined effects
                         caused by the two stressors.'''),
            Paragraph('''The biofilms exposed only to TCS recovered far better than those
                         subjected to both altered flow and subsequent TCS exposure: the latter suffered more
                         persistent consequences, indicating that simulated drought amplified the toxicity of this
                         compound. This finding has implications for river ecosystems, as it suggests that the toxicity
                         of pollutants to biofilms may be exacerbated following a drought.''')
